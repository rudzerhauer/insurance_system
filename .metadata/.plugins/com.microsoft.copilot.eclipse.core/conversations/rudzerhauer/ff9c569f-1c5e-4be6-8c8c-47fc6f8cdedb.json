I can\u0027t browse your GitHub account or clone other repos unless you put those files here or give me the repo contents/URLs to work from in this chat.\n\nWhat I can do next (pick one)\n- If your frontend lives in another repo, paste its repo URL here or upload the frontend folder into this workspace so I can open and inspect it.\n- If you don\u0027t want to copy the whole frontend, share the frontend\u0027s package.json (or equivalent), or the main entry files (e.g., `src/` files, `App.*`, routing, or HTTP client code). That’s usually enough to tell what framework and APIs it\u0027s calling.\n- If you want me to infer what the frontend should call, I can scan this backend (`src/main/java/com/example/controller/*`) and produce a plain API contract (endpoints, request/response shapes, auth behavior) so you can implement or verify the frontend against it.\n- If you prefer to keep repos separate, tell me the repo URL and I’ll give exact git commands and a short checklist you can run locally to clone it and then either upload relevant files here or paste key files into the chat.\n\nSuggested immediate action\n- Tell me which option you prefer, or paste one frontend file (or `package.json`) here. If you want the API contract, say “map the API” and I’ll read the backend controllers and return a concise endpoint list and example requests/responses.\n\nWhich would you like me to do now?",
